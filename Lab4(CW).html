<!---Create a "Podcast Introduction Page" for a beginner podcast series. The page should include:
   A title and description in the header.
   A semantic layout using <header>, <main>, and <footer>.
   An embedded YouTube video of the host's welcome video.
  An audio player for the first episode of the podcast.
  A short note about how the podcast content will be stored (just a placeholder paragraph mentioning storage).
Follow proper HTML5 style guide rules (like indentation, lowercase tags, attribute quotation, etc.).
Include a host profile section using the <aside> tag, placed beside the main podcast content.
Use a <figure> tag to display the host's image and a caption under it.
Goals:
   Practice semantic structure
   Embed media content
   Follow HTML style guidelines--->

      friends who had 1 meaningful conversation and decided to start “this is not a podcast”.
      We talk about our personal lives, events taking place across the world and basically provide our unsolicited
      opinion
      on anything and everything. If you are lonely, want to fill in the silences, kill time, learn about the most
      random things,
      this podcast is for you.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Hosted by Sharan Nair and three friends who once had a surprisingly deep
      conversation—and, in a moment of overconfidence and chaos, decided the world needed to hear more of it. That one
      chat spiraled into This Is Not A Podcast: a space where four fairly average people talk about absolutely anything,
      everything, and occasionally... nothing at all.
      We’re not journalists, philosophers, or life coaches—we’re just four friends navigating adulthood, culture, the
      internet, and our own lives one tangent at a time. Expect raw conversations, wild detours, questionable takes,
      personal confessions, and the kind of banter that feels like you're right there with us on the group call.
      Some episodes are funny. Some are surprisingly deep. Some might leave you wondering why you're still listening—but
      hey, isn’t that what the best group chats feel like?
      So if you:
    <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
      <li>need a break from the serious stuff,</li>
      <li>want to feel like you're in a room with friends,</li>
      <li>love hearing different perspectives (or just random trivia no one asked for),</li>
      <li>or simply want to fill the silence while doing dishes or pretending to work...</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Then congrats—you’ve found your people.
      This might not be a podcast in the traditional sense, but it’s definitely something.</p>
