       <p style="font-size: 20;">One of my main hobbies is playing e-sports, particularly BGMI (Battlegrounds Mobile
        India). I enjoy the strategic thinking, teamwork, and quick decision-making that the game demands. It helps me
        improve my focus, reflexes, and problem-solving skills under pressure. Playing e-sports is not only entertaining
        but also gives me a sense of competition and achievement, while at the same time helping me connect with friends
        and other players, enhancing collaboration and communication.</p> 

        <p style="font-size: 20;">Apart from gaming, I also have a strong interest in reading books and binge-watching series. Reading allows me
        to explore different perspectives, improve my knowledge, and enhance my creativity. On the other hand, watching
        series provides relaxation and helps me stay updated with diverse storytelling styles and ideas. Both these
        hobbies balance my personality — while e-sports keeps me active and competitive, reading and series-watching
        give me a chance to unwind, reflect, and learn in a more relaxed way.</p>
